## Introduction
---

Welcome to the Walmart AR Shopping Experience app! This Flutter application enhances both online and in-store shopping experiences using Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Users can try on items virtually, share their AR-enhanced looks on social media, and navigate physical Walmart stores with AR-powered directions and product information.

## Tech Stack
---

- *Flutter*: Cross-platform app development framework
- *Firebase*: Backend services and authentication
- *PostgreSQL*: Database management
- *Flutter AR Core*: AR functionality for Flutter

## System Design

The app follows a client-server architecture:

1. *Client-side*: Flutter app with AR capabilities
2. *Server-side*: Firebase for real-time data synchronization and user management
3. *Database*: PostgreSQL for storing product information, store layouts, and user data

The AR features are implemented using the Flutter AR Core plugin, which integrates with the device's camera and sensors to provide an immersive AR experience.
